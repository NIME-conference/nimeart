This repository is a fork of the ACM Publication Template for use in NIME.

The goal is to experiment with very minor changes that would allow the current ACM Publication Template to be used for NIME.
NIME uses a typical 2-column template for regular papers and a 1-column template for music, installation, and workshop publications.
Traditionally NIME has used A4 paper.

NIME traditionally used the old sig-alternate class forked in 2009. In 2019, NIME began to use a fork of acmart for 1-column music submissions.

The modifications for this derived package are:

- The `acmsmall` style has been modified to look better in a single column conference proceeding.
- All styles are modified to use A4 paper.
- The sample templates have been adjusted to produce 1- and 2-column conference proceedings documents relevant to NIME.

This code is distributed in compliance with the original package's LaTeX Project Public License with the original source available here: <https://github.com/borisveytsman/acmart>.

Any issues with `nimeart` should be raised in this repository. The authors of `acmart` bear no responsibility for anything going wrong with documents that use `nimeart`.
