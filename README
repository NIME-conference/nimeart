This repository is a fork of the ACM Publication Template for use in non-ACM conferences, specifically NIME.

- The `acmsmall` style has been modified to look better in a single column conference proceeding.
- All styles are modified to use A4 paper.
- The sample templates have been adjusted to produce 1- and 2-column conference proceedings documents.
